				<a class="indented"><p>Handcrafted by the many gods, and shaped by their will over time, Loor is a place of beauty and depth. From the Frosty Strand to the Range of Igni, there are numerous peoples, referred to as "folk" amongst themselves. Magical fae creatures, humans and beastfolk alike share this world. Each one created carefully by the gods to bring something special to the world. From brutal warlords to peaceful collaborative societies, these folk are diverse. A myriad of cultures live throughout Loor, and even more have lived and died through its history. Some well known and others left a mystery to the folk of Loor and even to the author of this guide. The flora and terrain is just as deep and diverse as the folk living among it all. So many places and things to see, so many folk to meet. This guide will be ever expanding, as entries are filled you will see the world of Loor grow before your eyes. You will meet new folk, see new cultures, and places and read tales of the many adventures they partake in. Be sure to return here often, you never know what you'll see!</p></a>
