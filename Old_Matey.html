					<p>This ship, originally named the Matey,  has lived a long and storied life. Bought for Ms. Wesley Bales by her father, it has sailed every inch of the Merchant's Sea. Although it has often transported expensive, and important cargo, the Matey has rarely seen combat. It's specialty was stealth, and Wesley used it well. Small and speedy, it can go undetected in the crowded Merchant's Sea for months, and even if you spotted it, you'd likely be unable to catch it. Most folks wouldn't have bothered chasing it to begin with, assuming it would never be used for important business. For a time the Matey was retired along with Ms. Wesley, but not for long. It sat at a pier,on the Pirate Coast, listed for sale for a few years, falling into disrepair. Just when it seemed the Matey might never sail again the Matey had a stroke of luck. Ms. Wesley's desire to sail again combined with that of a young man would bring it back out to the open ocean. Having aged a bit over the years, the Matey was given new life, a new Captain and a new name. From then on it would be fondly dubbed the "Old Matey". It would sail the Merchant's Sea again, and may even venture to new seas it had never seen before.</p>
