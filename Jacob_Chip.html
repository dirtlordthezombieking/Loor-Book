					<p>Jacob Chipp was born in No Man's Council and raised between there and the Pirate Coast. He had the average childhood of a boy growing up on an isle full of outcasts. He laughed and played with the boys in the small towns where he lived, not a care in the world. The only real sadness he felt as a child was when he had to leave his friends to move to the coast with his family. Soon enough he was happy again, having made new friends and found new places to explore.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>In his teen years, Jacob worked in his father's restaurant. It had been the reason for moving to the coast , and was now the family's bread and butter. Jacob enjoyed the art of cooking, and to him, it was definitely an art. His father taught him all the tricks of the trade and every one of his family recipes.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Jacob's favorite part of working at the restaurant was one of the regular customers. The most beautiful girl he'd ever seen, she came in every day for lunch, always ordering something different. Jacob always insisted on making her order, and always tried to outdo himself. He wanted desperately to impress her, hoping his cooking would catch her attention. They became close friends and eventually he started inventing new recipes just for her, just to get her to like him.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>One day he finally got up the courage to ask her on a real date. She agreed and they were on the path to marriage in no time at all. He cooked for her every night, and she never had any complaints. She loved every dish he made and always made sure to tell him.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>After his father's passing, Jacob and his wife took over the restaurant. They had no children so they had plenty of time to work there. They had a number of good years together, creating and perfecting new dishes, building their perfect menu. Unfortunately, one day his wife fell very ill.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>It started with a cough, but it progressed fast, before he knew it she couldn't work anymore. He had to spend more and more time caring for her. As a result, his restaurant began failing, his money began to run out. It took just over a year for her illness to finally take her, and when it did she was hardly herself anymore.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>With the loss of his wife came the loss of his restaurant. He couldn't bring himself to work there anymore, everywhere he looked he saw her reflection. Jacob decided he needed to get away from the coast, go somewhere new and start again.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>When a local girl got word that the best chef in town was leaving she came to try to convince him to stay. When she couldn't get him to stick around she offered him an alternative. She told him she was looking for a chef for her new pirate crew, and he would be a perfect fit for the job. She said he had some time to consider it but he knew he didn't need it. He agreed immediately, hoping this could be his fresh start. And that's how Mr. Chipp became the chef of the Old Matey.</p>
