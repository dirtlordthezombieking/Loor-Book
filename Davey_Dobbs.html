Davey grew up alongside his sister Gillian on the Pirate Coast of No Man's Island. Their father, a fisherman, toiled at sea day in and day out. He was often quite tired at the end of the day, but never let it stop him from being a good father. Despite losing their mother at a young age, the siblings never wanted for anything. Their father worked himself to the bone to pay for all of their needs, refusing to allow his children to do without anything. As a child Davey looked up to his father, wanting to be a seafarer too, and even worked on his father's fishing boat as a teen.

This was never enough for Davey, though. He wanted to see more, go out on the open ocean and make a name for himself. He wanted to be the captain of his own ship, a captain who would be remembered for ages to come. Unfortunately, this was the one thing his father could never provide for him, or so he thought.

 Upon the arrival of Davey's eighteenth birthday his father announced that he had a surprise for the boy. He marched Davey down to the pier and pointed at a small, rickety blue and gold ship and said "congratulations Captain Davey." His father had saved up over the years and gotten Davey his own ship. He'd even found him a guide, someone who could teach him how to be a good captain. Davey couldn't believe it, it was in need of some repairs, and maybe a coat of paint, but it was his. 

In less than a month, Davey had put together a small skeleton crew and stocked his ship with the minimal supplies they could afford on short notice. He was ready to hit the open sea and find himself an adventure. He couldn't wait to get out there and finally make a name for himself, but how? 

After a lot of consideration, and just as much ignored advice from his sister, Davey set his mind on a goal. He would sail the Merchant's Sea and build his crew in the hope of one day being the most famous pirate in all the world. He would work his way up, and defeat the biggest, scariest pirate out there. Surely everyone would know his name then, and he could sail the seas freely, unbothered by other pirates. That was it, Davey would become king of the sea, and he would do it as the Captain of the Old Matey!
