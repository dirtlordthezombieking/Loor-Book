					<p>Billy and Jules grew up in the Kingdom of Man. Their parents were both soldiers in the king's guard, working on the coast of the main island. Their job was to defend the shoreline and ensure no bandits from No Man's Island got into the kingdom. It was a well kept secret that there was a black market trade route running through their area of responsibility. Nobles often bought trinkets and foodstuffs from No Man's Island to be shipped through there. The king and his advisors were aware of it and made us of it regularly. It was only when the peasants found out and became outraged that the king felt he had to do something about it. Instead of shutting down the trade route, he had it moved to a new area, so it looked as if it had been stopped.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Unfortunately, the king felt he needed more to satiate the angry peasants, and so he put the guards on trial. All the guards working on the old trade route were publicly tried and locked up. This included the Rolfe twins' parents. They were teens by this point, and could fend for themselves in the kingdom, but they wouldn't be doing that for long. The anger of the peasants wasn't quelled enough by the trials, and the king became worried, so he banished the immediate family of all the tried guards on the grounds that they must have known what was happening. He even claimed that they must have helped commit the crimes.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>The twins were banished, left on the shore of the pirate coast, with no money to their names. They didn't have many skills that would be useful here, only one really. Their father had been a cannon operater, and he had shown them how to operate the cannons on the king's wall when they were younger. They figured their best bet was to work on a pirate ship, those had canons and canons needed cannoneers. They worked on a few ships over the next few months, learned the tricks of the trade. They found they enjoyed the pirate life, but they never stayed on one ship for too long, crews were shuffled often and it could be tough to find a steady job as a disposable cannoneer.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Finally, after months of changing crews and living frugally between jobs they found a posting that seemed permanent. They had overheard a young women, not much older than them, asking around for crewmen for her new ship. They seized the opportunity and offered their services. They were hired on the spot. They would work on a small, old ship, as the only cannoneers. The craft only had one canon on either side, so it would be manageable for the two of them and they would likely avoid much conflict. They would help run the rest of the ship, working the sails and such when not firing canons. They had learned plenty about working a ship in their months on the sea.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>The captain of the ship seemed eager to become more powerful. The twins found this rather helpful, they wanted to be powerful too. They wanted to be powerful enough to take on the Kingdom of Man and free their parents one day. For now, they were content to work on this new ship and build their way up. And that's how Billy and Jules Rolfe became the cannoneer twins of the Old Matey!</p>
