					<p>Ms. Wesley Bales has lived on the sea her whole life. Born to merchants she was ferried all over the Merchant's Sea and met numerous folks of all kinds. She could work most parts of her parents' ship by the age of twelve and she was a proficient salesman too. She could barter with the best of them and was known to play the part of an orphan to get a better deal.</p>
					<br>
					<p>When she was just sixteen she was given captaincy of a ship in her parents' fleet. Over the years she accrued unimaginable wealth, and sailed every inch of the Merchant's Sea. She even built her own small fleet that would be added to that of her parents when she inherited it upon their deaths. By far her favorite of the ships was the Matey, named so because she was fond of the word, as her father often used it . A small blue and gold ship which she used to carry her most valuable goods. It was, she thought, the best for the job because pirates and bandits would assume she's never put valuable cargo on such an easily defeated boat.</p>
					<br>
					<p>For nearly fifty years Wesley kept her hold over the sea, and the port towns surrounding it. But all good things must come to an end, and so, with age she tired. Even her beloved Matey grew weary with age. She thought it best to spend her days on dry land, not wanting to risk what she had built just to stay on the water for a few more years. At first she was eager to work on her empire from the shore. It was new to her and she enjoyed learning by trial and error. It was a fun experience, and it was easier on her old bones, but soon she grew bored. She longed for the sea. She couldn't justify captaining a ship anymore, it was too much work and she wasn't in her prime anymore.</p>
					<br>
					<p>She spent a few months pondering how she could get back out onto the sea, her sea, again, and one day it came to her. She recalled a fisherman who she often saw at the docks, always eyeing the ships that were posted for sale. Most folks, in her experience, only came by that dock once or twice, but not him. He came by every day and looked at the ships, often enquiring about prices. She went to that dock one day, and sure enough he was there, admiring a faded blue and gold ship.</p>
					<br>
					<p>She approached him and asked him what he was up to. He explained that his son had always wanted a ship of his own, but that they were too expensive, and so he couldn't afford any of them. Wesley knew this was her chance, finally, to get back to the sea. She offered the man a deal, he could have the ship, free of charge, but she must be a part of the crew. She wanted to sail on her Matey again, even if she had to do so from the background. The man eagerly agreed, and the two began planning a surprise.</p>
					<br>
					<p>For the boy's eighteenth birthday he would be given the captaincy of the Old Matey. He would build his own crew, but Wesley would be his first mate. She would offer her seafaring experience and would help him captain his ship. She signed control of her fleet over to her daughter and began her adventure anew. And that's how Ms. Wesley Bales became the first mate of the Old Matey!</p>
