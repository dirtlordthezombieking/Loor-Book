					<p>Tally was born and raised in the Burning Desert. He grew up in a nomadic flock, traveling based on wind currents. He learned the essentials of navigation from a young age, and he had a knack for it. The older folk in his flock often praised him for his navigational skills and his particularly good eye. He could spot things on the horizon long before the rest of the flock.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>At an early age Tally grew bored of the skies. He spent a lot of his time there, and if he wasn't flying he was surrounded by hot, dry sand. He often dreamed of going far away, somewhere entirely different from the desert. He kept these thoughts to himself, in a flock unity is important, and wanting to leave isn't something one just openly discusses. Instead, he silently planned his escape.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>One night, while the flock was asleep, Tally snuck out of his tent and took to the sky. He didn't know where he was going yet, but he knew he wanted out of the desert. He had heard talk of a place southeast of the desert, he didn't know if it was real. Supposedly you could be whoever and do whatever you wanted in this place, you could be totally free.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>He journeyed to the Fae Forest and stayed there for a time. He went from place to place, seeking knowledge about this rumored place where one could do anything. He travelled by the directions he was given until reaching an oceanside village. Here he found out that the place he had searched for was finally in reach, just a short boat ride away.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>With little money to his name, Tally couldn't afford the ride across. His freedom was so close, but so far, until he was approached by a strange man offering a free ride across the water. Though the man was suspicious, his face covered by a large animal skull affixed to his head, Tally agreed. He had to get across, he didn't come this far for nothing.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Tally was brought to the lower deck of a dilapidated old ship. He was seated with a few other passengers and told to keep quiet and stay put. The trip was uneventful, and gave no indication of what awaited on the other side.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>At the dock the passengers were ushered off the ship and given lodging in the small port town where they had docked. They were fed well that evening and then sent to their rooms where Tally bathed and went to bed, excited to see what the morning would bring. Unfortunately, most of them wouldn't see the sunrise.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Tally was awoken by screams in the middle of the night. He was unsure what to make of it, maybe someone had had a nightmare? In a daze he stumbled to the hallway where he met some of the others. As they stood trying to figure out what was happening they almost didn't see the threat approaching them. The stomping is what alerted them. From down the hall a large man, some sort of beastfolk, was running toward them, and object in his hands. The others couldn't see it but of course Tally could. The beastman was carrying the head of one of the other passengers in his clenched fist.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Tally turned and ran back to his room, the beast screaming behind him, "That's right, run for your lives, it'll only make you taste better!". Fearing for his life Tally did what was natural to him, he leapt from the window and took to the sky. After such a narrow escape he refused to look back.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>With no supplies and little rest Tally only managed to find civilization again through pure terror. He flew through the night and most of the morning, following the coast and avoiding any place that didn't look downright hospitable. Eventually he landed on the Pirate Coast and learned he was on No Man's Island.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>The sea seemed perfect, the total opposite of the desert, and nobody here seemed to want to eat him, which was a bonus. Tally decided he wanted to work on the sea, and maybe live there too. He didn't know much about ships but he figured navigation was important, and so set off to find someone in need of a navigator. Lucky for him, there was a new ship in town, looking for fresh crew members and they weren't being too picky either. And so a navigator he became, and the best one in the Merchant's Sea at that! And that's how Tally Gregor became the navigator of the Old Matey!</p>
