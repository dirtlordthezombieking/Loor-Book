				Rum Tum-Tum, affectionately known as Tum-Tum or Tummy, was born on a farm in No Man's Council. He was the runt of the litter and during his birth something went wrong, he survived, but lost one of his legs. It never bothered him much, his siblings didn't seem to care and it was all he ever new. His mother was a barn cat, she'd spent her life catching mice and other pests to keep them out of the humans' crops. Unfortunately, the humans didn't need a litter full of barn cats, and so he and his siblings were sold off to different places.
				<br/><br/>
				Tum-Tum never found out where he's been sold to. One day he was placed on the back of a carriage and driven away from the farm where he was born. The carriage travelled for a long time, following  cobble roads and dirt paths. Eventually the cart stopped, and , being the curious kitten he was, Tum-Tum peeked over the wall of the carriage. He saw lots of buildings, sort of like the farmhouse but smaller and more packed together, and people walking around everywhere. Children playing, people hanging out clothes to dry, so much happening!
				<br/><br/>
				After a moment or two a smell caught Tummy's attention. He didn't know what it was, but it smelled delicious. Without another thought, he hopped out of the carriage and followed his nose. He wandered for a minute or two before arriving at another cart, this one full of that yummy smell, some kind of meat, it seemed. Eager for a taste, Tummy jumped into the cart and began eating. It was cold and salty, but it tasted delicious. He munched and munched and munched until he got sleepy, and he fell asleep
				<br/><br/>
				He was suddenly awoken by the shouts of an angry man. He was scared but before he could run away the man picked him up, saying he would have to pay for all the fish he'd eaten. The man marched into a nearby building and tossed Tummy into a cage. That's where he stayed for the next few days, occasionally being fed that delicious meat the man had called "fish". Tummy didn't much like his cage but he didn't see any way of escaping so he settled in and tried to relax. Occasionally people, many with children, would come peer at him through the bars. They would talk about him, asking questions of the man, but eventually they would all leave after noticing his missing leg.
				<br/><br/>
				Finally, one day, a young woman came to see him, she called herself Gillian and she was nice. She stroked him and even scratched him between the ears. Tum-Tum liked Gillian, and she liked him, she gave the man some money and picked up the cage. She took him to a new place made of wood. It smelled of salt and lots of other unfamiliar things. She let him out of his cage in a big room with some cots and barrels and things. She told him he could go wherever as long as he stayed in the ship. She said he'd need to catch mice and pests and such to earn his keep. Tum-Tum was so excited, he would be just like his mother, he would be the best pest cat he could be.
				<br/><br/>
				Over the next few weeks Tummy set about doing his job, protecting the ship from pests. He met some new people who apparently planned to live on the ship, they were all very nice. They seemed happy with the job he was doing, and after a while they even rewarded him with a little hat and a vest. They gave him a nametag too, and dubbed him the cat-ptain of the ship, joking that he looked just like the captain. Tummy was happy with his new life on the ship.
				<br/><br/>
				After a while the humans started getting very excited, talking of a maiden voyage, and launching the ship. He wasn't sure what that meant but if they were excited so would he be. Shortly before the day of the launch arrived the humans called Tummy up to the main deck. He came eagerly, expecting some fish or some other kind of treat. Instead he was presented with a hunk of carved wood. He was confused at first, but then Gillian affixed it to the stump of his missing leg. It was awkward at first but Tum-Tum was excited to have his new leg. He spent lots of time practicing and was back to his peat catching self in no time. And that's how Rum Tum-Tum became the cat-ptain of the Old Matey!
