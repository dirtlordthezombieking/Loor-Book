					<p>Gillian grew up on the Pirate Coast of No Man's Island. Her mother died when she was just a child but her father more than made up for it. He always made sure that she and her brother Davey had everything they could want. He spent all day at sea, working on a fishing crew to pay for his children's needs. He was often exhausted, but he cared for them with all the energy he could muster.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Being the older sibling, Gillian made sure to help out when she could. She helped look after Davey when her father was working or too tired. She was happy to do it too, she loved caring for her little brother. He was always so happy and eager to prove himself. He always had to be the best at everything, and never settled for less.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Gillian was never the most feminine girl in town, she wasn't much into clothes and jewelry and such. As such, she mostly stayed at home, and she didn't have many friends. The folks she was friends with were mostly shopkeepers from whom she bought food and household goods.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>When Davey was old enough to work on the boat with his father Gillian was left by herself during the day. She had always done odd jobs around town for extra money,  but now she had more time on her hands with Davey at sea all day. After some thought she decided she wanted to try something new so she sought out a local swordsman, hoping to learn a thing or two. Although she preferred to defuse conflict, she figured she should learn how to handle herself if it ever came down to a fight.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>She wasn't so great at first, but she stuck with it and after a few years she was as good as any other swordsman you could pick off the beach. Her mentor had taught her to focus on throwing her opponent off, he said psychological warfare was her safest bet, and that her thin stature would help too. It was better for her opponent to underestimate her.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>She had spent most of her time protecting Davey from himself. She often had to talk him out of doing dangerous or stupid things. At times it seemed he had no sense in his head at all. So naturally, when their father gave Davey his own ship, Gillian knew what she had to do.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>There was no way Gillian could let her little brother out on the open sea alone. She had to go with him to make sure he didn't get himself in any trouble. She helped him pick his crew and stock his ship with supplies. In no time at all they were out on the ocean and Gillian was back to work keeping her brother in check, and boy did she have her work cut out for her! Not only did she have to keep Davey in line, but the other crew members too. They even dubbed her 'The Voice If Reason' because she so often put a damper on their antics. Of course, Gillian didn't mind this at all, she had always been that for Davey, and was content to do it for the crew as well. And if it came down to it, she would protect them with her sword. And that's how Gillian Dobbs became the quartermaster of the Old Matey!</p>
